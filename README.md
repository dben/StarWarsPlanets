STAR WARS PLANETS
===
This is a QBasic game I wrote between 1998 and 2002.
The original game is basically a single player moisture farming and battle simulator (ala harvest moon)
before I ended up getting creative and trying to build it into something much bigger with the turn based
multiplayer "Party Edition". While the game never gained my whole dream list of features, it was a pretty
great effort for a middle schooler. 

Disclaimer: I haven't tried to run this recently, so I'm not sure if it still works or not. 

From the party edition comments:
```
Star Wars Planets is a game that mixes text adventure, board, and multiplayer games all into one.
 Features wanted to include:
 1. Land/Property colonization and management
 2. Bartering, trading, and shops
 3. Numerous occupations like shopkeeper, bounty hunter, weapons designer,
    used ship salesperson, adventurer, soldier (, and later politician,
    smuggler, biologist, & hunter)
 4. City founding
 5. actual massive 'Smart' AIs - or at least smart enough to act like normal
    people to passers-by (who don't run away to corners in the desert and
    into walls fighting blindly with anyone in contact, and who don't give
    new objects away for $0.02 if you ask them enough)
 6. Interaction in a turn-based game (with AI, other players, ghost AI, etc.)
 7. A good battle system with fair play
 8. Explorable lands where players can live wherever they want
 9. Skill levels
10. Ability to add plotline for different players (a.k.a. Captain Typho,
    Jedi, etc.)
11. To make all the above features into an enjoyable FUN text game (if there
    is such a thing) that would appeal to 10 people to play for at least
    20 minutes, and that would seem realistic
